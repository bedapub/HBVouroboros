HBVouroboros uses RNA-sequencing reads to infer HBV genotype, quantify HBV transcript expression, and perform genome as well as amino acid variant calling. 


Features
--------

- Automate majority of tasks for sequencing-based HBV genotyping and expression quantification
- offers three ron-modes, genome inference at the dataset and sample level, as well as dataset-level analysis against an input genotype.
